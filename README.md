# Janelia-JHU-Bootcamp-Materials
This repository will house all the necessary materials for the tutorial on spike train analysis taught at the Janelia bootcamp for PhD students at Johns Hopkins by Simon Locke and Ernst Niebur. Materials will include a short PDF tutorial with exercises to be completed using a small set of mfiles.

The tutorial includes an introduction to point processes, cross-correlation and the jitter method of spike resampling. The tutorial will include additional material on generating Monte Carlo data and hypothesis testing. There will also be an opportunity for students to work with synthetic data and recorded data from Macaque motor cortex.
