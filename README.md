# Janelia-JHU-Bootcamp-Materials

Monkey data (Niebur Lab)

This repository will house all the necessary materials for the tutorial on spike train analysis taught at the Janelia bootcamp for PhD students at Johns Hopkins by Simon Locke and Ernst Niebur. Materials will include a short PDF tutorial with exercises to be completed using a small set of mfiles.

The goal of this tutorial is to learn the basics of spike train analysis and give an introduction to point processes, cross-correlation and the jitter method (Amarasingham et al., 2012). The tutorial will include additional material on generating Monte Carlo data and hypothesis testing. To start the tutorial, open the PDF called "Spike Train Analysis & The Jitter Method". We provide exercises involving creation and analysis of synthetic data and analysis of recorded data from Macaque motor cortex. These tasks will involve learning a couple basic algorithms and implementing them in Matlab.
